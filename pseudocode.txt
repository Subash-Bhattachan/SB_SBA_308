Pseudocode - Dont be vague, be clear with what you want to do

- Open an array Result as a container to hold the student data
- Enter the for loop to make sure the assignment - assignment Id - compare Id if it matches with the course ID
- After we make sure we are in the correct course ID, we move ahead with the rest of code.


- Create a studentData object that holds data in the form of key-value pair.
- declare what the keys are going to be and then the subsequent values they are going to carry
- initiate all the values to be zero for average and total score and possible total score.
- Then enter another second for loop that is going to run through the length of the value of the StudentData object to 
  calculate the average of the scores based on the assignments that the students have submitted.
- Calculate the averages depending on when the assignment was submitted, whether it passed the due date or not. 


- The data that studentData holds is then pushed to results array for the final print.
